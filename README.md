# ***Before you interact / Info :o3c***

-  **16+** to interact on safe server. I hide anyone I find annoying (mostly people who are being assholes)
- **18+** to interact on 18+ server (obviously)
-  I generally dislike DNIs... however I will say that if I find out that someone is **pro-contact or part of the TCC**, I will **__BLOCK/HIDE__** them. I'm sorry, they just make me VERY uncomfortable.
- Selfshipper. Ponies of my f/os usually have 'F/O' in their name.
-  Very unlikely to actually respond. I have VERY bad (social) anxiety. Talking to people is often impossible for me. Please don't take it personally.
- P.L.U.R, and I fucking mean it. Be nice to people. 
-  Mostly just here to create ponies and sit around.
